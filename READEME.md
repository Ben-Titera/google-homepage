A recreation of the Google homepage in HTML/CSS. 
This is my first time writing HTML/CSS, and this project idea comes from The Odin Project.

As of 06/23/2021, this project is complete. I made the project look as similar as I could
to the current Google homepage without any of the functionality. There is still some room for
improvement; in particular,

    --- Currently, when hovering over the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button on the actual Google
	homepage, it scrolls through a list of alternative text and displays one of them.
   
    --- The "Google apps" icon on the actual Google homepage is an array of circles, whereas
	the one I implement (which was obtained from Google Fonts) is an array of squares.
	I attempted to make my own icon using a CSS grid, but for some reason the circles
	looked all lumpy unless you scrolled in really close.

    --- When hovering over the "Google apps" icon on the actual Google homepage, a gray circle
	appears behind it. In my version, hovering over it just changes the color of the icon.

    --- The page doesn't react exactly how I would like while resizing it. Most of it looks good,
	but the spacing on the footer can get a little wonky.

I may or may not come back and fix these issues. Right now I'm kind of beat since I did this
whole project in pretty much a single sitting, so perhaps later I will be a little more willing.
